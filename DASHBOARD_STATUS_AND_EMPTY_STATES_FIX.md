# Dashboard Status Display and Empty States Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Event Status Now Shows as Text (Not Numbers)
**Problem**: In the dashboard's "Upcoming Events" section and "Faculty Chosen" section, event statuses were displayed as numbers (0, 1, 2, 3) instead of readable text.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `getStatusColor()` function to work with numeric status values
- Added `getStatusText()` function to convert status numbers to readable text
- Updated all status displays to use `getStatusText(event.status)`

**Status Mapping**:
- `0` → "Under Review" (🟠 Orange)
- `1` → "Approved" (🟢 Green)
- `2` → "Planned" (🔵 Blue)
- `3` → "Rejected" (🔴 Red)

**Files Changed**:
- `TaskMates/Views/Home/Index.cshtml` (lines 330-348)

### 2. ✅ Faculty Chosen Shows Empty State
**Problem**: When all events were either "Under Review" or "Rejected", the Faculty Chosen section would try to show events that weren't actually approved/planned.

**Solution**:
- Filter events to only include **Approved** (status 1) or **Planned** (status 2) events
- If no approved/planned events exist, show a friendly empty state message
- Empty state displays:
  - ⭐ Icon (grayed out)
  - "No Events Chosen At This Time"
  - Subtitle: "Faculty endorsed events will appear here"
  - Card is not clickable

**Files Changed**:
- `TaskMates/Views/Home/Index.cshtml` (lines 251-279)

### 3. ✅ Upcoming Events Shows Empty State
**Problem**: The "Upcoming Events" section would show events regardless of their status, including rejected or under-review events.

**Solution**:
- Filter events to only show **Approved** (status 1) or **Planned** (status 2) events
- Display up to 3 upcoming events
- If no approved/planned events exist, show empty state message:
  - 📅 Icon (grayed out)
  - "No Upcoming Events"

**Files Changed**:
- `TaskMates/Views/Home/Index.cshtml` (lines 295-318)

## Technical Implementation

### Status Helper Functions

```javascript
function getStatusColor(status) {
    const colors = {
        0: '#f59e0b', // Under Review - Orange
        1: '#10b981', // Approved - Green
        2: '#3b82f6', // Planned - Blue
        3: '#ef4444'  // Rejected - Red
    };
    return colors[status] || '#6c757d';
}

function getStatusText(status) {
    const statusMap = {
        0: 'Under Review',
        1: 'Approved',
        2: 'Planned',
        3: 'Rejected'
    };
    return statusMap[status] || 'Unknown';
}
```

### Faculty Chosen Logic

```javascript
// Only consider approved or planned events
const approvedEvents = events.filter(e => e.status === 1 || e.status === 2);
const facultyChosen = approvedEvents.find(e => e.isFacultyChosen) || 
                      approvedEvents.filter(e => e.isEndorsed)[0];

if (facultyChosen) {
    // Show the event with proper status text
} else {
    // Show empty state
}
```

### Upcoming Events Logic

```javascript
// Only show approved or planned events
const upcomingEvents = events.filter(e => e.status === 1 || e.status === 2);

if (upcomingEvents.length > 0) {
    // Show up to 3 events with status as text
} else {
    // Show "No Upcoming Events" message
}
```

## Visual Improvements

### Before:
- Faculty Chosen: Showed any event, even rejected ones
- Upcoming Events: Showed all events with status as numbers (0, 1, 2, 3)
- No feedback when no appropriate events existed

### After:
- Faculty Chosen: Only shows approved/planned events, with proper empty state
- Upcoming Events: Only shows approved/planned events with text status ("Approved", "Planned")
- Empty states provide clear user feedback with icons and messages

## Testing

### Test Status Display:
1. Open the dashboard
2. Check "Upcoming Events" section
3. Verify statuses show as:
   - "Approved" (green badge)
   - "Planned" (blue badge)
   - NOT as numbers

### Test Faculty Chosen Empty State:
1. As admin, set all events to "Under Review" or "Rejected"
2. Refresh dashboard
3. Verify Faculty Chosen section shows:
   - Grayed out star icon
   - "No Events Chosen At This Time" message
   - Card is not clickable

### Test Upcoming Events Empty State:
1. As admin, set all events to "Under Review" or "Rejected"
2. Refresh dashboard
3. Verify Upcoming Events section shows:
   - Grayed out calendar icon
   - "No Upcoming Events" message

### Test With Approved Events:
1. As admin, set at least one event to "Approved" or "Planned"
2. Refresh dashboard
3. Verify:
   - Event appears in "Upcoming Events" with proper status text
   - If endorsed, appears in "Faculty Chosen"
   - Clicking event cards navigates to Events page

## Summary

All three dashboard issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Event statuses display as readable text with colored badges
- ✅ Faculty Chosen only shows approved/planned events with empty state fallback
- ✅ Upcoming Events only shows approved/planned events with empty state fallback

The dashboard now provides clear, accurate information with appropriate visual feedback! 🎉
