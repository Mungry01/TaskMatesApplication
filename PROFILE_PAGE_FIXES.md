# Profile Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Removed "Total Likes Received" from Student Profile
**Problem**: Student profiles displayed a "Total Likes Received" statistic that counted all likes on their ideas and events.

**Solution**: Removed this stat box completely. Student profiles now show only:
- Ideas Submitted
- Events Suggested
- Volunteering

**Files Changed**:
- `TaskMates/Views/Home/Profile.cshtml` (lines 251-265)

### 2. âœ… Removed "Total Items Reviewed" from Faculty Profile
**Problem**: Faculty profiles showed "Total Items Reviewed" which counted all ideas and events in the system (not just ones they reviewed).

**Solution**: Removed this stat box. Faculty profiles now show only:
- Total Endorsements
- Ideas Endorsed
- Events Endorsed

**Files Changed**:
- `TaskMates/Views/Home/Profile.cshtml` (lines 331-345)

### 3. âœ… Fixed Admin Profile to Show Correct Information
**Problem**: Admin profile statistics weren't working because the code was checking event status against string values like `'UnderReview'`, `'Approved'`, etc., but the backend stores status as numeric enum values (0, 1, 2, 3).

**Solution**: Updated all status checks to use numeric values:
- `0` = Under Review
- `1` = Approved
- `2` = Planned
- `3` = Rejected

**Changes Made**:
1. Fixed statistics calculation (lines 388-390)
2. Fixed events breakdown display (lines 436-439)
3. Updated `getStatusClass()` function to work with numeric status
4. Added `getStatusText()` function to convert numbers to readable text
5. Updated event status display in student and faculty profiles

**Files Changed**:
- `TaskMates/Views/Home/Profile.cshtml` (lines 387-506)

## Additional Improvements

### Status Display Functions
Added two utility functions for consistent status handling:

```javascript
function getStatusClass(status) {
    // Map numeric status to Bootstrap color classes
    const statusClasses = {
        0: 'warning',   // Under Review - Orange
        1: 'success',   // Approved - Green
        2: 'info',      // Planned - Blue
        3: 'danger'     // Rejected - Red
    };
    return statusClasses[status] || 'secondary';
}

function getStatusText(status) {
    const statusMap = {
        0: 'Under Review',
        1: 'Approved',
        2: 'Planned',
        3: 'Rejected'
    };
    return statusMap[status] || 'Unknown';
}
```

### Event Status Display
Event statuses now display correctly as text with appropriate colors in:
- Student profile: "My Suggested Events" section
- Faculty profile: "Endorsed Events" section
- Admin profile: Events management breakdown
