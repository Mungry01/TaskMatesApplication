# Admin and Event Status Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Admin Cannot Volunteer for Ideas
**Problem**: Admin users had access to the volunteer button on ideas, which should only be available to students.

**Solution**: 
- Changed the condition from `currentUser.role !== 'faculty'` to `currentUser.role === 'student'`
- Now **only students** can volunteer for ideas
- Faculty can endorse (already implemented)
- Admin can only like and delete ideas

**Permissions Summary**:
- **Students**: Can Like ❤️ and Volunteer 🤝
- **Faculty**: Can Like ❤️ and Endorse ✅
- **Admin**: Can Like ❤️ and Delete 🗑️

**Files Changed**:
- `TaskMates/Views/Home/Ideas.cshtml` (line 256)

### 2. ✅ Event Status Shows Text Instead of Numbers
**Problem**: Event status was displaying as numbers (0, 1, 2, 3) instead of readable text like "Approved", "Planned", etc.

**Root Cause**: The `EventStatus` enum was being serialized as integers in JSON, and JavaScript was displaying the numeric value directly.

**Solution**:
- Created a `getStatusText()` helper function that maps enum values to readable strings:
  - `0` → "Under Review"
  - `1` → "Approved"
  - `2` → "Planned"
  - `3` → "Rejected"
- Updated all `${event.status}` references to use `${getStatusText(event.status)}`
- Applied to both the event cards list and the event details modal

**Code Added**:
```javascript
function getStatusText(status) {
    const statusMap = {
        0: 'Under Review',
        1: 'Approved',
        2: 'Planned',
        3: 'Rejected'
    };
    return statusMap[status] || 'Unknown';
}
```

**Files Changed**:
- `TaskMates/Views/Home/Events.cshtml` (lines 525-533, 250, 303)
